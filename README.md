## Builds
( 1 )
**Best build**

*Just a Scratch* - allows to recover from downed state everytime and recover 15/25/35 percent faster

*Last Energy* - allows to recover by yourself once a match and grants a speed boost of 30/40/50 percent to recovery speed

*Dodge* - OG DeadHard(dead by daylight). Using it if killer trying to hit you, because with **Legit Dash** you will be knocked(not everytime)

*Salvation*/*Rakish* - allows to escape off of first hook if you unhooked any survivor **OR** if you was hooked in the basement


[Realization]

- Set **FastVault Speed**(press "Delete" to open Configuration) to 0.60, you will be faster at fast vaults(but not at pallets) and no one says about your fast vaults(*legit*)
- Set **Speedhack**(press "Delete" to open Configuration or change it in pre-start configuration) to 2.0 and just hold Q sometime(*rage/legit*, guys saying GG after that :D)
- Set **ESP Settings** in Pre-Start Configuration: ***Pallets,Windows,Players & Killer,Generators,Hatch,Exit Gate***, allows to see everything and chasing like a god without any speedhacks(*fully legit*)
- In chase you already getting advantage(EPS, speedhack, hacked fast vaults); if killer going to hit you press **Dodge Perk**(not Legit Dash); Chase some time and press **Legit Dash** for increase distance but not in hit timing because killer easily give you a hit(*legit gameplay*)
- In chase you can use **Rage Dash**/**Legit Dash** everytime killer getting near you, just do it(Legit Dash) or teleport(Rage Dash) into any construction(*rage gameplay*)
- If you got killed and you in downed state just teleport somewhere and recover(with **Best Build** you recovering so fast, *rage gameplay*)
- Important to safe someone from hook because it grants you ***Salvation Perk*** so you 100% escaping from first hook **OR** just nevermind about saving and get killed in the basement to also 100% escape from first hook(*legit gameplay*)
- You can OFF all functions(dashes, speedhack, vaults) and just ON ESP, 100% legit gameplay
- To safe anyone from hooking, teleport to near hook and start sabotaging it with ***Toolbox*** and teleport somewhere while Sabotaging, killers dont understanding whats going on(*rage gameplay*)
- Enjoy of Destroying DBR!
